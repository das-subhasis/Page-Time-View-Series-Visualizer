# Page-Time-View-Series-Visualizer
Analysis of views of a page on freecodecamp.org and present the findings through data visualization techniques.

!! FreeCodeCamp "Data Analysis With Python" Certification Course Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze the number of views for a specific page on freecodecamp.org. 
We will determine the month in which the page was most visited and present our findings through the use of bar plots, box plots, and line plots. 
By visualizing the data, we can draw meaningful conclusions about the page's viewership over time.
